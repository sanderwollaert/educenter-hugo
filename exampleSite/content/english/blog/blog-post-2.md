### Indicate page titles by using title tags

A title tag tells both users and search engines what the topic of a particular page is. The \`<title>\` tag should be placed within the \`<head>\` tag of the HTML document. Ideally, you should create a unique title for each page on your site.

### Page title contents are displayed in search results

If your document appears in a search results page, the contents of the title tag will usually appear in the first line of the results (if you're unfamiliar with the different parts of a Google search result, you might want to check out the anatomy of a search result video by Google engineer Matt Cutts, and this helpful diagram of a Google search results page). Words in the title are bolded if they appear in the user's search query. This can help users recognize if the page is likely to be relevant to their search.

The title for your homepage can list the name of your website/business and could include other bits of important information like the physical location of the business or maybe a few of its main focuses or offerings.

### Best practices

#### Accurately describe the page's content

Choose a title that effectively communicates the topic of the page's content.

* **Avoid** choosing a title that has no relation to the content on the page.
* **Avoid** using default or vague titles like "Untitled" or "New Page 1"

#### Create unique title tags for each page

Each of your pages should ideally have a unique title tag, which helps Google know how the page is distinct from the others on your site.

* **Avoid** using a single title tag across all of your site's pages or a large group of pages

#### Use brief, but descriptive titles

Titles can be both short and informative. If the title is too long, Google will show only a portion of it in the search result

* **Avoid** using extremely lengthy titles that are unhelpful to users
* **Avoid** stuffing unneeded keywords in your title tags
